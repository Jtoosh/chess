# Computer Science 240: Advanced Software Construction

## Pre-Class studying

### Java Basics

I worked on the Java W3 Schools exercises during the break, heres some bits I learned:

- Java is more syntax strict, like C++. Strings need to be in "", '' is for characters. Semi-colons after every line, case-sensitive, etc.
- `println` adds a newline char after the string, `print` does not.
- Comments are `//` for single line, `/* */` for multi-line.
- Variables must be typed, but don't need to be declared with a var keyword like JS.
- Multiple variables can be assigned in one line, like `int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;`. They can also all be assigned the same value, with assignment operators in between each variable.
- Type casting is done with `()` around the type, like `(int) myDouble;`. When moving from a smaller primitive type to a larger one, it is called a Widening Cast, and is done automatically. When moving from a larger type to a smaller one, it is called a Narrowing Cast, and must be done manually.
- For review, the primitive types in Jave are: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
- Operators are similar/same as in C++.
- In Java, the length of a string is a method of the string (`.length()`), not a property or a separate method. Finding the index of the first occurrence of a char (or array element for that matter) is done with `.indexOf()`. When using `.indexOf()`, on a string, the char you are searching for is placed in "", not ''.
- Apart from the normal way with the `+` operator, Strings can be concatenated with the `.concat()` method.
- Escape characters are handled like normal, with a `\` before the character.

### Git Review

- `git branch` - without an argument lists the branches, with an argument creates a new branch with that name.
- `git checkout` - switches branches, can also be used to create a new branch with the `-b` flag.
- `git diff` - when passed with two versions, by providing the commit hashes, shows the differences between the two versions.
- Add the `-a` flag to `git commit` to commit all changes, without needing to add them first. `git commit -am "message"`. This is a shortcut for `git add .` and `git commit -m "message"`.
